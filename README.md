# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 39th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

I completed the "Pricing Component with Toggle" challenge from Frontend Mentor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project sharpened my layout skills and focused on building an accessible custom toggle control. It was an engaging experience, combining design precision with functionality, and improving my understanding of interactive component development.


**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
